== Overview ==

An Input validator is a program that tests input data for correctness.  

A validator program must be an application (executable or interpreted) capable of being invoked with a command line call. The details of this invocation are described below.

== Invocation ==

When invoked the input validator will get the input file on stdin.

The validator should be possible to use as follows on the command line:

  ./validator [arguments] < inputfile

== Output ==

The input validator may output debug information on stdout and stderr. This information may be displayed to the user upon invocation of the validator.

== Exit codes ==

The input validator must exit with code 42 on successful validation. Any other exit code means that the input file could not be confirmed as valid.
