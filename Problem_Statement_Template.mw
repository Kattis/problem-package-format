=== Overview ===

Problem statements are
written in LaTeX, containing only the actual problem statement, no sample data
(the .tex file is included in a template that
adds these).  A typical problem.tex looks as follows:

 \problemname{Problem Name}
 
 <Problem statement here>
 
 \section*{Input}
 
 <Input description here>
 
 \section*{Output}
 
 <Output description here>


=== Additional options ===

In case the problem name consists of special LaTeX code (for instance, math, or escaped characters), a "plain" version of the problem name must be specified by a comment of the form 

 %% plainproblemname: Problem Name

in the beginning of the file.
