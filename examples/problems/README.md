# Sample Problem Packages

Work in progress.

This directory contains some sample problem packages that are meant to illustrate how the Problem Package Format works.

`passfail`, `submit_answer`, `scoring`, `interactive`, `multipass` are meant to resemble typical problem packages of the corresponding types. `maximal` is meant to illustrate all features (as far as it is possible) of the Problem Package Format â€” it is *not* meant to resemble a typical problem package.
