\problemname{Sample Scoring Problem}
This is a sample problem to illustrate how the Problem Package Format works.
\section*{Input}
Input consists of one integer $N (-1000 \le N \le 1000)$.
\section*{Output}
Print N.
\section*{Constraints and Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
Each test group contains a set of test cases.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
  \hline
  Group & Points & Constraints\\ \hline
  $1$   & $30$   & $0 \le N \le 1000$ \\ \hline
  $2$   & $70$   & No further constraints \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
