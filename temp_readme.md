# Problem Package Format Specification

This site contains the specification for the Kattis Problem Package Format.
There are currently three versions:

- The latest (draft) version: <https://www.kattis.com/problem-package-format/spec/2023-07-draft.html>.
- The current version: <https://www.kattis.com/problem-package-format/spec/legacy.html>.
- The ICPC subset of the current version: <https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/spec/legacy-icpc.html>.

The latest (draft) version is not yet widely supported, 
but if you're building tools and systems you should definitely take a look at it. 
If you're creating problems for official ICPC contests you should not assume more than the ICPC subset without talking to your technical staff.

Development happens in the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/Kattis/problem-package-format>.
Contrubutions and comments are very welcome!

  It is not intended to be more than that.
